## Setup

- Clone this repository.
- `cd` into the project.
- Run `npm install`.
- Create `.env` file
```
SESSION_SECRET=somesecret
SERVER_PORT=3005
```
- Run `nodemon`
- Visit `http://localhost:3005`

## Use

- Have the students visit `http://[your ipaddress]:3005` in the browser, __but ask them not to send any messages yet__.
- Instructor should visit `http://localhost:3005` in the browser. Explain to the students that this is basically the same project that they just built for the mini. They should recognize what they see in the browser. 
- Instructor should visit `http://localhost:3005/#/store`. This is a visual depiction of the session store. Make sure that is VERY clear to the students that what they are seeing is just a representation of what is occurring server side.
- Ask a volunteer to send a message. Then ask another volunteer to send a message. Two sessions have been created and each session is keeping track of the messages sent by each student. Have the volunteers send multiple messages.
-Invite other students to join in.
